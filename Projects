Project 1: COVID-19 Case prediction (COMP9318)*
Duration : One month
Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn
 - Analysed COVID-19 dataset for various days with daily conditions of temperature, wind speed, dew point and pressure as input parameters and extracted features for training dataset.
 - Created an SVM Machine Learning model for analysing the time series of COVID-19 cases as a function of past COVID-19 cases and the weather conditions.
 - Genearted a report based on tested model evaluations with supporting evidence to justfy the model and its features.
 
Project 2: Rating Prediction (COMP9444)*******
Duration : One month
Technologies used: Python, Numpy, Pytorch
 - Developed a pytorch program that learns to read product reviews in text format and predict an integer rating from 1 to 5 stars associated with each review.
  
Project 3: Site selection for Expansion of Smiths Lake field station (GEOS9016)
Duration: Three Months 
Technologies Used: ArcGIS
 - Developed a consultancy report in a group of 3 for selection of site for the expansion project.
 - Generated various models for each criteria of site selection; Soil Erosion model, Conservation Model, Building Model.
 - Used open source datasets for various criteria such as Atlas of Living for Endangered Flora and Fauna, etc.
 - Applied various concepts of GIS to develop DEM of the sites for the selection of candidate sites.
 
 Project 4: Seek-Rats: Comprehensive Secret Detection solution
 Duration: Three Months
 Technologies Used: Python, Javascript, AWS Boto3/Lambda, Github, Jira, Pytest, Terraform
  - Developed a comprehensive secrets detection tool in a group of 5 members.
  - Solution developed could be used to plug in to an existing CI/CD Pipeline.
  - Detection of secrets done at various stages to perform a comprehensive secret detection.
  - Creation of an 'Allowlist' to store all false positives of secrets for cross verification later.
  - Worked on developing a Pre-Commit Hook which scans commited code for any hard coded secrets which cross-verifies.
  - Created comprehensive testing regime using Pytest to ensure bug-free code.
  - Use of Jira for progress tracking and weekly checkins to ensure team progress.
